PROBLEM-------------------------------
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. 
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

ALGORITHM-----------------------------
  I.Initialize integer value sum as 0.
 II.Start a loop from 0 to 1000, loop value incrementing each time by 3.
III.Add that value to sum and repeat until value is 1000.
 IV.End the loop.
  V.Start another loop from 0 to 1000, this time loop value incrementing each time by 5.
 VI.Add that value to sum and repeat until value is 1000.

PSEUDOCODE---------------------------
Set integer sum as 0
Input integer i
for (i=0) do
  	Add i to sum
  	Increment i by 3
Repeat until (i=1000)
End do
End for
for (i=0) do
  	Add i to sum
  	Increment i by 5
Repeat until (i=1000)
End do
End for
for (i=0) do
  	Subtract i from sum
  	Increment i by 15
Repeat until (i=1000)
End do
End for
Print sum
